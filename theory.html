      <p>
        To have a better idea about the wireless communication using Antennas we
        must understand that wireless communication is done in the form of
        waves. Hence, we will be discussing various parameters of antennas to
        understand and analyse its working. Before proceeding with the
        experiment, we must learn some basic terminologies: <br />
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Frequency</li>
        <li>Wavelength</li>
        <li>Impedance matching</li>
        <li>VSWR and Reflected Power</li>
        <li>Radiation Intensity</li>
        <li>Radiation Resistance</li>
      </ul>
      <h4><u> Frequency </u></h4>
      <p>
        According to the standard definition, “The rate of repetition of a wave
        over a particular period of time, is called as frequency.” Simply,
        frequency refers to the process of how often an event occurs. A periodic
        wave repeats itself after every ‘T’ seconds (time period). Frequency of
        periodic wave is nothing but the reciprocal of time period (T).
      </p>
      <h4><u> Wavelength </u></h4>
      <p>
        According to the standard definition, “The distance between two
        consecutive maximum points (crests) or between two consecutive minimum
        points (troughs) is known as the wavelength.” Simply, the distance
        between two immediate positive peaks or two immediate negative peaks is
        nothing but the length of that wave. It can be termed as the Wavelength.
        The following figure shows a periodic waveform. The wavelength (λ) and
        amplitude are denoted in the figure. The higher the frequency, the
        lesser will be the wavelength and vice versa.
      </p>
      <h4><u> Impedance Matching </u></h4>
      <p>
        According to the standard definition, “The approximate value of
        impedance of a transmitter, when equals the approximate value of the
        impedance of a receiver, or vice versa, it is termed as Impedance
        matching.” Impedance matching is necessary between the antenna and the
        circuitry. The impedance of the antenna, the transmission line, and the
        circuitry should match so that maximum power transfer takes place
        between the antenna and the receiver or the transmitter. 
        <br><br>
        <u>Necessity of Matching:</u>
        <br>
        A resonant device is one, which gives better output at certain narrow band of frequencies. Antennas are such resonant devices whose impedance if matched, delivers a better output. 
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li> The power radiated by an antenna, will be effectively radiated, if the antenna impedance matches the free space impedance. </li>
          <li> For a receiver antenna, antenna’s output impedance should match with the input impedance of the receiver amplifier circuit. </li>
          <li> For a transmitter antenna, antenna’s input impedance should match with transmitter amplifier’s output impedance, along with the transmission line impedance. </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h4><u> VSWR and Reflected Power </u></h4>
      <p>
        According to the standard definition, “The ratio of the maximum voltage to the minimum voltage in a standing wave is known as Voltage Standing Wave Ratio.”
        If the impedance of the antenna, the transmission line and the circuitry do not match with each other, then the power will not be radiated effectively. Instead, some of the power is reflected back.
        <br>
        <br>
        The key features are: 
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li> The term, which indicates the impedance mismatch is VSWR. </li>
          <li> The higher the impedance mismatch, the higher will be the value of VSWR. </li>
          <li> The ideal value of VSWR should be 1:1 for effective radiation. </li>
          <li> Reflected power is the power wasted out of the forward power. Both reflected power and VSWR indicate the same thing. </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h4><u> Radiation Intensity </u></h4>
      <p>
        “Radiation intensity is defined as the power per unit solid angle”. <br>
        Radiation emitted from an antenna which is more intense in a particular direction, indicates the maximum intensity of that antenna. The emission of radiation to a maximum possible extent is nothing but the radiation intensity.
        <br>

      <h4><u> Radiation Resistance </u></h4>
      <p>
        Radiation resistance is that part of an antenna's feedpoint electrical resistance that is caused by the radiation of electromagnetic waves from the antenna.[1] In radio transmission, a radio transmitter is connected to an antenna. The transmitter generates a radio frequency alternating current which is applied to the antenna, and the antenna radiates the energy in the alternating current as radio waves. Because the antenna is absorbing the energy it is radiating from the transmitter, the antenna's input terminals present a resistance to the current from the transmitter.
